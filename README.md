To recreate the "floating feeder cone" model in CATIA V5 with exact specifications and dimensions, follow these steps based on the extracted details:

---

### **1. Prepare CATIA V5**
- Open CATIA V5 and create a new **Part Design** document.

---

### **2. Base Geometry: Cone Shape**
1. **Create a Sketch**:
   - On the **XZ-plane**, draw a triangle representing the profile of the cone.
   - Dimensions:
     - Height: 50 mm (from -5.5 mm to 50 mm on the Z-axis).
     - Base radius: 31.75 mm (diameter 63.5 mm).
   - Close the triangle.

2. **Revolve the Sketch**:
   - Use the **Shaft** tool to revolve the sketch around the central axis (Z-axis).
   - This creates the basic cone structure.

---

### **3. Trim the Base**
1. **Sketch a Cutout**:
   - Create a sketch on the **XZ-plane** for the bottom part (-5.5 mm).
   - Draw a circle with a slightly smaller radius than the base of the cone (e.g., 31.7 mm).
   - Use the **Pocket** tool to create a cut or trim.

---

### **4. Fine Features**
   Depending on the STL details, you might add:
   - **Fillets**: Smooth the edges using the **Edge Fillet** tool.
   - **Holes or Slots**: Create additional features by drawing sketches and using the **Pocket** or **Hole** tools.

---

### **5. Verify Dimensions**
   - Use the **Measure** tool to ensure all dimensions match:
     - Overall Height: 50 mm.
     - Base Diameter: 63.5 mm (31.75 mm radius).
     - Other dimensions as required from the bounding box.

---

### **6. Save the Part**
   - Save the part as a CATPart file.
   - If needed, export it as an STL for 3D printing or further analysis.
